title: GlussCon -- A Gluss Controller
---


# GlussCon


This is a project of Public Invenstion in support of [The Gluss Project](http://pubinv.github.io/gluss/), a radical approach to robotics trying
to build a general purpose metamorphic machine. Like all Public Invention projects, it is completely open-source and does not seek patents.

The Gluss Controller, or GlussCon, explores the possibility of building a hand-manipulable controller which is a puppet or doll--a miniature version of
the larger GlussBot which is to be controlled.  By pushing the GlussCon into position with the hands, the GlussBot can be instructed to assume the same
configuration (but on a large scale.)  The hope is that in this way a work person can easily control the GlussBot in doing tasks that would otherwise
be difficult to specify.

The GlussCon project is led by Evan Bartilson and Joshua Hannan, with input from Robert L. Read.

# Approach So Far

The GlussCon project is just beginning.  The team is currently exploring the possibility of encasing a linear potentiometer in a 3D printed enclosure
to form a connector.  An Arduino will be used to read the the resitance (and hence the amount of contraction or expansion of the connector) of the
linear potentiometer.  The connectors will join to the turret joints produced at an appropriate scale to produce a network of tetrahedra
corresponding precisely in shape (but in miniature) to a GlussBot geometry.  The current position will be transmitted via Bluetooth of WIFI to
the computer controller the GlussBot.

At present, we have purchased Linear Potentiometers, practices reading their values, and designed but not printed, a moving enclosure.
Some additional 3D design work is needed to allow connections to the "rotors" of the Turret joints.

# Plans

When we have worked out these CAD modeling, we will begin 3D printing of the joints, rotors, and encosures and attempt to assemble first a
single triangle, then a tetrahedron, then a complete 5-Tet GlussBot, the current Gluss model.

If mechanically satisfactory, we intend to use a MUX chip controlled by an Arduino to read the positions of the potentiometers.


# How to Contribute

We welcome your participation, in either the GlussCon project, the Gluss project, or one of the other Public Invention projects.
To discuss the GlussCon project specifically, email Joshua Hannan 
<hannanjoshua19@gmail.com> (Github: [joshuahannah](https://github.com/joshuahannan)). You are welcome to email Robert L. Read <read.robert@gmail.com> to discuss how you can help the Public Invention projects in general.

However, as a public projects, it is even better for you to comment publicly
on these projects.
You can do this by opening an ("issue")[https://github.com/PubInv/PubInv/issues] here at GitHub.  If you want to add to or improve one of the existing documents, you can do this with a "pull request".

You may wish to subscribe to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T8XSMhwKUE">YouTube Channel</a>. Since we are bound neither by the need to keep something secret due to patent restrictions imposed by Universities, nor by the formality of Academic publishing, nor by the need to maintain trade secrets, we publish informally a lot at YouTube.
